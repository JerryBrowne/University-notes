# Measuring Electron Spin Resonance
Since its discovery in 1945, electron spin resonance (ESR) has been at the core of many problems in medicine, chemistry, and physics. ESR is based on the absorption of high-frequency radiation by paramagnetic substances in an external magnetic field, in which we observe a split of electron spin states into separate energy levels.
In this experiment, we will investigate this effect. Using a passive RF oscillator, we will study resonance absorption within our environment. We will then use Helmoltz coils and a sample paramagnetic substance to measure electron spin resonance. Through the comparison of these results to expected values of non-magnetic environments, we will observe present magnetic fields in the lab.
