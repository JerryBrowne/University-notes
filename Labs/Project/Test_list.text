Evaluated tests:
-Basic Haynes Shockley experiment: presence majority & minority carriers -> drif velocity & mobility electrons: at different injected voltages+ pulse lengths -> drift vs voltages
- calc: drift velocity, mobility, thermal velocity, mean free hole time scatter
- carrier diffusion: hole pulse broadening
- test per collector - how distance affects measurement
- reversing the field/polarity - nothing?
