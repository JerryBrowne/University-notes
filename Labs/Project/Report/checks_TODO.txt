- re-read text and check it makes sns ✔

- make sure data and axis are consistent  ✔
- try to fix that last conclusion issue on the side  ✔
- cross-check with grading: perhaps more work on uncertainty would be appropriate: see fig 11-12 distance uncertainty perhaps? check the other things on the grading scale  ✔
