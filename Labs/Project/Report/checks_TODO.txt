- check data correct: using the right gradients, mobility, etc
- check every fig description
- fix stuff in caps
- re-read text and check it makes sns
- run through plagiarism and ai checks just in case
- make sure data and axis are consistent
- try to fix that last conclusion issue on the side 
- cross-check with grading: perhaps more work on uncertainty would be appropriate: see fig 11-12 distance uncertainty perhaps? check the other things on the grading scale

==> submit final version! make sure student n is fine
