apparatus before theory
-> goal is to find adiabatic cnst


Team - B2
-----------
gravity - det grav acceleration cnsts
small angle eqtions of motion
drag force

compound pendulum + fallen bodies
errors quite high

Team - B3
-----------
astro - small telescopes


Team - B4
----------
derivations magnetic braking force

Team - B5 (feedback)
----------------------
Q: 
(theo) n vs p - might be worth testing
(theo) creation of holes?
(exp) heating - how?why?safety?
(exp) interference peaks (top & bottom)
(analysis) skew?

Feedback (to improve):
liked photos equipment and oscilloscope readings
add name 1st slide
