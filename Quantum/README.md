Description:		Aims:
The aims of this unit are to introduce the Schrödinger equation and its solution in one and three dimensions, and to discuss the interactions responsible for the electronic structure of atoms.

Learning Outcomes:
After taking this unit the student should be able to:
* explain the significance of the wavefunction in determining the physical behaviour of electrons;
* show how quantisation arises from boundary conditions and calculate energy levels in simple model systems;
* discuss the energy levels, angular momenta and spectra of atoms, taking into account screening and magnetic interactions.

Skills:
Numeracy T/F A, Problem Solving T/F A.

Content:
Basic assumptions of quantum mechanics (4 hours): Wave functions, probability density and normalisation. Observables; position, momentum and energy. Schrödinger's equation; time dependence of the wavefunction, stationary states, superposition and measurement, time-independent Schrödinger equation.
Motion in one dimension (6 hours): Eigenfunctions of the infinite square well, parity of solutions, superposition states. Dirac notation. Bound states of the finite square well. Motion of free particles. Reflection and transmission at a step. Tunnelling through a barrier. The harmonic oscillator. Time-independent perturbation theory.
The Schrödinger hydrogen atom (4 hours): Angular wavefunction, radial wavefunction, full solutions, energy and atomic spectra, electronic states of many electron atoms.
Angular momentum in atoms (4 hours): Orbital angular momentum, spin angular momentum, Dirac notation, superposition, Pauli spin.
Magnetic properties of atoms (4 hours): Magnetic moments, total angular momentum, spin-orbit interaction, perturbation theory, Zeeman effect and Stern Gerlach experiment.
