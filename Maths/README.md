Description:		Aims:
The aim of this unit is to introduce more advanced mathematical concepts and techniques, and to show how these may be used for different applications. It also aims to continue the development of students' problem-solving skills and their understanding of mathematical results.

Learning Outcomes:
After taking this unit the student should be able to:
* calculate and interpret derivatives of vector functions of one variable;
* parameterise curves;
* define and transform between Cartesian, plane polar, cylindrical polar and spherical polar coordinates;
* visualise points, lines, planes and volumes in these coordinates;
* define scalar, vector and conservative fields;
* evaluate and interpret grad, nabla2 and directional derivatives of scalar fields in the above coordinate systems;
* evaluate and interpret div and curl of vector fields in the above coordinate systems;
* evaluate and interpret line, surface and volume integrals in the above coordinate systems;
* identify conservative fields and find their potential functions;
* use and interpret vector integral theorems;
* evaluate Fourier series and transforms, and use their properties to solve problems;
* use transform methods to solve differential equations;
* apply Fourier techniques to problems in the physical sciences;
* recognise and solve some of the key equations which arise in the natural sciences;
* apply the separation of variables method to linear partial differential equations, and solve the resulting ordinary differential equations by series solution;
* use spherical harmonics to represent functions defined on the surface of a sphere;
* outline key properties of finite- and infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

Skills:
Numeracy T/F A, Problem Solving T/F A.
